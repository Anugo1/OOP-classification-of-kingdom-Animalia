# In relation with the four elements of object oriented programming these were used:

### 1. Inheritance
An animal Parent class was created which all the classes inherited from to avoid re-implementing the same functionality, to make the code simplified making it easier to make changes to the code, and it allowed me to make use of another OOP paradign 'Polymorphism'.

### 2. Abstraction
Abstract methods were used in the neccessary places to prevent misuse of some classes.

### 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism was used to enforce method overriding in to classes that had different but similar methods.

### 4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation was used to improve code security by making some methods and properties of an object private

## Way to run the code:
- Clone this repository in your pc 
- Be sure to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Then run the code.

# Your output should be this
